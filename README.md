# NodeSentry

Node.js is a popular JavaScript server-side frame-work with an efficient runtime for cloud-based event-driven architectures. Its strength is the presence of thousands of third party libraries which allow developers to quickly build and deploy applications.These very libraries are a source of security threats as a vulnerability in one library can (and in some cases did) compromise oneâ€™s entire server. 

In order to support the least-privilege integration of libraries we develop NodeSentry, the first security architecture for server-side JavaScript. Our policy enforcement infrastructure supports an easy deployment of web-hardening techniques and access control policies on interactions between libraries and their environment, including any dependent library

## Examples

Two examples showcase the real-life use case of the library.

### Adding custom HTTP headers

This example shows how you can add a custom HTTP header to any outgoing HTTP response of your HTTP server.
Please note that NodeSentry requires you to enable all harmony features of V8/Node.js when running node (use `node --harmony`).

```javascript
/* Enable NodeSentry */
var Policy = require("nodesentry").Policy;

/* This policy says that before a call to `ServerResponse.writeHead()` is
 * actually invoked, a custom header gets added to the response object.
 * More information on the Node.js API for HTTP server interactions on
 * http://nodejs.org/api/http.html */
var policy = new Policy()
    .before("ServerResponse.writeHead")
        .do(function(response) {
            return response.setHeader("X-NodeSentry", "What Else?!");
}).build() // build the actual policy object

/* Use `safe_require` to enforce generated policy */
var http = safe_require("http", policy);
//var http = require("http");

/* Pre-existing/unmodified application code */
var port = 12345;
var server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {
    res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
    return res.end('Hello World\n');
}).listen(port);
```
